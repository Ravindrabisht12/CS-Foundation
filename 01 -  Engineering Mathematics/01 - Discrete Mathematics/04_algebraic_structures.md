# 04. Algebraic Structures

An algebraic structure consists of a non-empty set `S` and one or more binary operations on `S`.

## 1. Monoids
A **monoid** is an algebraic structure `(S, *)` where `S` is a non-empty set and `*` is a binary operation that satisfies two properties:

1.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c ∈ S`, `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.
2.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e ∈ S` such that for every `a ∈ S`, `a * e = e * a = a`.

**Examples:**
- The set of non-negative integers `(ℕ₀, +)` with the operation of addition. The identity element is 0.
- The set of strings over an alphabet `Σ` with the operation of concatenation. The identity element is the empty string.

## 2. Groups
A **group** is a monoid where every element has an inverse. It is an algebraic structure `(G, *)` that satisfies four properties:

1.  **Closure:** For all `a, b ∈ G`, `a * b ∈ G`. (This is implicit in the definition of a binary operation).
2.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c ∈ G`, `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.
3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e ∈ G` such that for every `a ∈ G`, `a * e = e * a = a`.
4.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a ∈ G`, there exists an element `a⁻¹ ∈ G` such that `a * a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ * a = e`.

**Abelian Group:** A group is called **abelian** (or commutative) if the operation is also commutative, i.e., `a * b = b * a` for all `a, b ∈ G`.

**Examples:**
- The set of integers `(ℤ, +)` with addition is an abelian group. The identity is 0, and the inverse of `a` is `-a`.
- The set of non-zero rational numbers `(ℚ*, ×)` with multiplication is an abelian group. The identity is 1, and the inverse of `a` is `1/a`.

- **Subgroup:** A subset `H` of a group `G` that is itself a group under the operation of `G`.
- **Cyclic Group:** A group that can be generated by a single element (the generator).
