# Theory of Computation Study Guide

This folder contains a structured study guide for the Theory of Computation (TOC), also known as Automata Theory. The topics are organized to build a strong foundation from basic models of computation to the limits of what can be computed.

## Study Roadmap

1.  **`01_introduction_to_automata.md`**: Introduces the fundamental concepts of automata theory, including symbols, alphabets, strings, languages, and the Chomsky Hierarchy.
2.  **`02_regular_languages_and_finite_automata.md`**: Covers regular expressions, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), and their equivalence.
3.  **`03_context_free_languages_and_pushdown_automata.md`**: Details Context-Free Grammars (CFG) and Pushdown Automata (PDA), the model of computation for context-free languages.
4.  **`04_pumping_lemma.md`**: Explains the Pumping Lemma for both regular and context-free languages, a key tool for proving that a language is *not* in a particular class.
5.  **`05_turing_machines.md`**: Introduces the Turing Machine, a powerful and universal model of computation.
6.  **`06_undecidability.md`**: Explores the limits of computation, including the Halting Problem and the concept of undecidable problems.

## How to Use

-   Start with the `README.md` in the parent `CS Foundation` directory for the overall structure.
-   Follow the topics in numerical order for a coherent learning path.
-   Each file contains navigation links (`Prev`, `Next`, `Index`) at the bottom to move between topics easily.
-   Check the `RESOURCES.md` file for a curated list of external learning materials.

Happy learning!
