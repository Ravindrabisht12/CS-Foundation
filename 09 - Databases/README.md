# Database Management System (DBMS) Study Guide

This folder contains a structured study guide for Database Management Systems (DBMS). The topics cover the core concepts from data modeling to transaction management.

## Study Roadmap

1.  **`01_introduction_to_dbms.md`**: Introduces the basics of DBMS, its advantages over file systems, and different data models.
2.  **`02_er_model.md`**: Covers the Entity-Relationship model, a high-level data model used for conceptual database design.
3.  **`03_relational_model.md`**: Details the most widely used data model, including concepts like relations, tuples, attributes, and keys.
4.  **`04_relational_algebra_and_calculus.md`**: Explains the formal query languages for the relational model: Relational Algebra (procedural) and Tuple/Domain Relational Calculus (non-procedural).
5.  **`05_sql.md`**: Covers the standard language for interacting with relational databases, including DDL, DML, and DCL commands.
6.  **`06_normalization.md`**: Discusses the process of organizing columns and tables to minimize data redundancy, covering various normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).
7.  **`07_file_organization_and_indexing.md`**: Explains how data is physically stored on disk and the use of indexing structures like B-Trees and B+ Trees to speed up data retrieval.
8.  **`08_transactions_and_concurrency_control.md`**: Covers the concept of transactions, ACID properties, and the protocols used to manage concurrent access to the database (e.g., locking, timestamping).
