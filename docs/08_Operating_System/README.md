# Operating System Study Guide

This folder contains a structured study guide for Operating Systems (OS). The topics are organized to cover the core concepts of how an OS manages computer hardware and provides services for programs.

## Study Roadmap

1.  **`01_introduction_to_os.md`**: What an OS is, its functions, and different types of operating systems.
2.  **`02_processes_and_threads.md`**: Covers processes, threads, process states, inter-process communication (IPC), and system calls.
3.  **`03_cpu_scheduling.md`**: Details the algorithms used by the OS to decide which process gets to use the CPU (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin).
4.  **`04_concurrency_and_synchronization.md`**: Explains the challenges of concurrent execution and the mechanisms used to ensure data consistency (e.g., mutexes, semaphores, monitors).
5.  **`05_deadlock.md`**: Discusses the problem of deadlock, including its causes, prevention, avoidance, and detection.
6.  **`06_memory_management.md`**: Covers how the OS manages the main memory, including techniques like paging and segmentation.
7.  **`07_virtual_memory.md`**: Explains how virtual memory allows a system to run programs larger than the physical memory, covering concepts like demand paging and page replacement algorithms.
8.  **`08_file_systems.md`**: Details how data is stored and organized on secondary storage, including file structures, directory structures, and disk scheduling.
