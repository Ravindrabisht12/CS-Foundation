# 01 - Engineering Mathematics

This section covers foundational mathematical concepts that are essential for computer science.

## Study Roadmap

This module is divided into four main sub-topics. It is recommended to study them in the order presented.

1.  **[Discrete Mathematics](01_Discrete_Mathematics/README)**
    -   Covers logic, sets, relations, groups, graphs, and combinatorics.

2.  **[Linear Algebra](02_Linear_Algebra/README)**
    -   Covers matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and LU decomposition.

3.  **[Calculus](03_Calculus/README)**
    -   Covers limits, continuity, differentiability, maxima/minima, mean value theorem, and integration.

4.  **[Probability and Statistics](04_Probability_and_Statistics/README)**
    -   Covers basic probability, conditional probability, random variables, common distributions, and descriptive statistics.
