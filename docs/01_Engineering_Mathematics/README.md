# 01 - Engineering Mathematics

This section covers foundational mathematical concepts that are essential for computer science.

## Study Roadmap

This module is divided into four main sub-topics. It is recommended to study them in the order presented.

1.  **[01 - Discrete Mathematics](./01%20-%20Discrete%20Mathematics/README.md)**
    -   Covers logic, sets, relations, groups, graphs, and combinatorics.

2.  **[02 - Linear Algebra](./02%20-%20Linear%20Algebra/README.md)**
    -   Covers matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and LU decomposition.

3.  **[03 - Calculus](./03%20-%20Calculus/README.md)**
    -   Covers limits, continuity, differentiability, maxima/minima, mean value theorem, and integration.

4.  **[04 - Probability and Statistics](./04%20-%20Probability%20and%20Statistics/README.md)**
    -   Covers basic probability, conditional probability, random variables, common distributions, and descriptive statistics.
