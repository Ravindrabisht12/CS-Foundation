# External Resources for Compiler Design

This file contains a curated list of high-quality external resources to supplement your study of Compiler Design.

## 1. Online Courses

-   **NPTEL - Principles of Compiler Design by Prof. S.K. Aggarwal, IIT Kanpur**:
    -   [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJRL6-i3g52vDBtA_S1I424-)
    -   *A comprehensive course that covers the GATE syllabus in great detail.*

-   **Stanford CS143: Compilers (OCW)**:
    -   [Course Website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
    -   *A classic course on compilers with excellent lecture notes, assignments, and a full project to build a compiler.*

-   **Coursera: Compilers by Prof. Alex Aiken**:
    -   [Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/compiler)
    -   *A hands-on, project-based course where you build a complete compiler for the COOL programming language.*

## 2. Books

-   **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools** by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman:
    -   This is the **"Dragon Book"** and is considered the bible of compiler design. It is the definitive reference for the subject.

-   **Modern Compiler Implementation in C/Java/ML** by Andrew Appel:
    -   A practical, hands-on guide to building a modern compiler. It's a great supplement to the more theoretical Dragon Book.

## 3. Tools

-   **Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)**:
    -   A tool for generating lexical analyzers (scanners) from a set of regular expressions.

-   **Bison (GNU Parser Generator)**:
    -   A tool for generating parsers from a context-free grammar. Often used with Flex.

-   **Compiler Explorer (Godbolt)**:
    -   [Website](https://godbolt.org/)
    -   An interactive online tool that lets you see the assembly output of various compilers for C++, C, Rust, and other languages. Incredibly useful for understanding the output of the code generation and optimization phases.

## 4. Q&A and Communities

-   **Computer Science Stack Exchange**:
    -   [Compilers Tag](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/compilers)
    -   A great place for specific, high-level questions about compiler theory.

-   **GeeksforGeeks - Compiler Design**:
    -   [Compiler Design Section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-design-tutorials/)
    -   Contains a large number of articles explaining concepts and providing examples.
