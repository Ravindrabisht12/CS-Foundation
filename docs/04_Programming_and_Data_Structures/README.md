# Programming & Data Structures in C

This module provides a structured path to mastering programming fundamentals in C and the essential data structures required for competitive exams like GATE and technical interviews.

## Study Roadmap (Recommended Order)
1.  **C Programming Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, operators, control flow.
2.  **Pointers & Memory Management:** The core of C programming; understanding pointers, `malloc`, and `free`.
3.  **Recursion:** Thinking recursively and understanding the call stack.
4.  **Arrays:** Static data structures.
5.  **Structs & Unions:** Creating custom data types.
6.  **Stacks:** LIFO data structure and its applications.
7.  **Queues:** FIFO data structure and its variations.
8.  **Linked Lists:** Dynamic data structures (singly, doubly, circular).
9.  **Trees:** Hierarchical data structures, terminology, and traversals.
10. **Binary Search Trees (BST):** A key ordered tree structure.
11. **Heaps:** Priority queue implementation (Min-Heap, Max-Heap).
12. **Graphs:** Representing and working with network data.

## How to Practice
- **Implement Everything:** The best way to learn data structures is to implement them from scratch in C.
- **Solve Problems:** Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksforGeeks to solve problems categorized by data structure.
- **Visualize:** Use online visualizers to see how data structures change during operations.
