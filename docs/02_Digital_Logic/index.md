# Digital Logic â€“ Structured Roadmap

This module builds the foundation for Computer Organization. Follow the ordered progression; each topic file contains: definitions, derivations, design patterns, examples, pitfalls, quick questions, and exam tips.

## Topic Order
1. Number Systems & Data Representation
2. Boolean Algebra & Logic Identities
3. Combinational Circuits (Standard Modules & Design)
4. Logic Minimization (K-Map & Quine-McCluskey Intro)
5. Sequential Circuits (Latches, Flip-Flops, FSM Design)
6. Fixed-Point Arithmetic (Signed Representations & Integer ALU)
7. Floating-Point Basics (IEEE 754 Essentials)

## Core Exam Weight Focus
- High yield: Boolean simplification, K-map grouping, sequential design timing, number conversions, overflow detection.
- Medium: Code conversions, hazards (static/glitch), arithmetic circuits (adders, subtractors), IEEE 754 decoding.

## Snapshot Formulas / Rules
| Concept | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Bits for N states | âŒˆlogâ‚‚ NâŒ‰ |
| 2's Comp Range (n bits) | âˆ’2^{nâˆ’1} .. 2^{nâˆ’1}âˆ’1 |
| Overflow (2's add) | Carry into MSB â‰  carry out |
| Gray -> Binary | b_i = b_{i+1} âŠ• g_i |
| Propagate / Generate | P = AâŠ•B, G = AB |
| IEEE 754 Value | (âˆ’1)^s Ã— (1.f) Ã— 2^{eâˆ’bias} (normalized) |

## Strategy
First Pass: Read definitions + solved examples
Second Pass: Design from requirements (truth table â†’ minimized â†’ gate/netlist)
Third Pass: Timed mixed mini-sets (10â€“15 questions)
