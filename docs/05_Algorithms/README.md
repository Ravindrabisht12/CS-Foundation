# Algorithms Study Guide

This folder contains a structured study guide for fundamental algorithms, designed to align with the GATE CS syllabus.

## Study Roadmap

The topics are organized logically to build a strong foundation in algorithm design and analysis.

1.  **`01_analysis_of_algorithms.md`**: Understanding Asymptotic Notation (`O`, `Ω`, `Θ`) and analyzing time and space complexity.
2.  **`02_searching_sorting_hashing.md`**: Essential algorithms for data retrieval and ordering, including linear/binary search, various sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap), and hashing principles.
3.  **`03_algorithm_design_techniques.md`**: Core strategies for solving complex problems.
    -   **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices (e.g., Huffman Codes, Fractional Knapsack).
    -   **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down problems into overlapping subproblems (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence).
    -   **Divide and Conquer**: Splitting problems into smaller, independent subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
4.  **`04_graph_algorithms.md`**: Algorithms for traversing and analyzing graph data structures, including BFS, DFS, Minimum Spanning Trees (Prim's, Kruskal's), and Shortest Path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall).

## How to Use

-   Start with the `README.md` in the parent `CS Foundation` directory for the overall structure.
-   Follow the topics in numerical order for a coherent learning path.
-   Each file contains navigation links (`Prev`, `Next`, `Index`) at the bottom to move between topics easily.
-   Check the `RESOURCES.md` file for a curated list of external learning materials.

Happy learning!
