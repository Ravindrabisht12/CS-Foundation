# Algorithms Study Guide

This folder contains a structured study guide for fundamental algorithms, designed to align with the GATE CS syllabus.

## Study Roadmap

The topics are organized logically to build a strong foundation in algorithm design and analysis.

## Algorithm Design Techniques Covered
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices (Huffman Codes, Fractional Knapsack)
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down problems into overlapping subproblems (0/1 Knapsack, LCS)
- **Divide and Conquer**: Splitting problems into smaller, independent subproblems (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
