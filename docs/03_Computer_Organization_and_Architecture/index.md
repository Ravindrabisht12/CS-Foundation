# Computer Organization & Architecture (COA)

A structured, examâ€‘oriented yet conceptâ€‘deep roadmap for mastering COA (GATE / technical interviews / fundamentals). Navigate sequentially or jump via the topic index.

## Study Roadmap (Recommended Order)
1. CPU Organization & Performance Metrics
2. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) & Machine Instructions
3. Addressing Modes
4. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) & Integer Arithmetic
5. Floating Point Representation & Arithmetic (IEEEâ€‘754)
6. Datapath & Micro-operations
7. Hardwired vs Microprogrammed Control Unit
8. Instruction Pipelining & Hazards
9. Memory Hierarchy (Cache, Main Memory, Virtual Memory)
10. I/O Systems (Interrupts, DMA, Buses)
11. Parallelism Basics (ILP, SIMD/MIMD overview)
12. Performance Tuning & Typical GATE Problem Patterns

> Extra topics (Parallelism, Performance tuning) included for completeness & intuition though core GATE weight centers around ISA, Pipelining, and Memory.

## How to Use
- First pass: Read summaries + solved examples.
- Second pass: Attempt end questions without looking.
- Final revision: Recreate key formulas table from memory.

## High-Yield Formula Snapshot (Preview)
| Concept | Formula / Rule | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| CPI | Avg CPI = Î£ (Instruction Type Fraction Ã— CPI) | Use for CPU time |
| CPU Time | T = (Instr Count Ã— CPI Ã— Cycle Time) | Or / Clock Rate |
| Amdahl | Speedup = 1 / ( (1 - f) + f/s ) | f = fraction improved |
| Cache AMAT | AMAT = Hit Time + Miss Rate Ã— Miss Penalty | Include write-back cost if asked |
| Address bits | = log2(Addressable Units) | Usually bytes |
| DRAM Access | t_access â‰ˆ Row Access + Column Access | Over-simplified |
| Pipeline Speedup | â‰ˆ n / (1 + stall cycles fraction) | Ideal = n |

## Revision Strategy
- Spaced repetition: (Day 0, Day 2, Day 7, Day 21) for formula recall.
- Practice: At least 40 cache + 30 pipeline + 20 ISA problems.
- Maintain an error log: Track misconception categories.
